# About YS Trading Coach

## 🎯 Our Vision

YS Trading Coach exists to help retail traders unlock consistent profitability using real-world market principles—**Price Action** and **Volume**. We focus on teaching what actually works, not selling dreams or magic indicators.

---

## ❓ Why We Exist

Many traders waste years chasing:
- Free but incomplete content
- Holy grail indicators
- Tips and “jackpot” calls

Most either give up or keep searching in circles.  
We’re here to change that—by **giving you structure, strategy, and mentorship rooted in experience**.

---

### 🔸 **Trading with Price Action & Volume (PAV)**

- ✅ **Modules 1 & 2**: *Introduction to Stock Market* — taught personally by Yogesh Patil, **completely free** and open to all  
- 🔐 **Modules 3–8**: Advanced topics including VPA, Volume Profile, VWAP, Risk & Trade Management  
  - 🧠 **Free to read after login**  
  - 💬 **Personal mentorship (with full teaching & query resolution)** is **available as a paid program**

## 🚫 What We’re Not

We don’t offer:
- Trading tips or calls
- “Quick money” promises
- Courses made from copy-paste YouTube content

This is **serious education**—for traders who want to build skill, not rely on luck.
